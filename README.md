Made With...

Happy Meter was developed using the MEAN stack, with a starring role by the Ionic Framework for hybrid app development. 

MongoDB: 

    (from "humongous") is an open-source document database, and the leading NoSQL database.

Express.js: 

    a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and     multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

AngularJS: 

    a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend          HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.

Node.js: 

    a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses     an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time     applications that run across distributed devices.

Ionic:

    The beautiful, open source front-end framework for developing hybrid mobile apps with HTML5.
